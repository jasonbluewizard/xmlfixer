      Casey arranges 12 phoenix feathers in a rectangular pattern on a table. If one side has 3 feathers, how many feathers are on the other side?

      <choice id="D">
        4 feathers
      </choice>
    </choices>
    <explanation>
      To find out how many feathers are on the other side of the rectangle, we need to use multiplication. Casey arranged 12 feathers in total, and one side of the rectangle has 3 feathers. We can find the number of feathers on the other side by dividing the total number of feathers by the number of feathers on one side: 12 ÷ 3 = 4. This means there are 4 feathers on the other side. The answer is 4 feathers.

      To find out how many potions Morgan can brew, we need to divide the total number of herbs by the number of herbs needed for each potion. Morgan has 450 healing herbs, and each potion requires 50 herbs. We divide 450 by 50, which is 450 ÷ 50 = 9. This means Morgan can brew 9 potions. The answer is 9 potions.

      To find out how many more ounces of healing herbs Quinn needs, we start with the total amount he needs, which is 3 ounces. He already has 1 ounce. We subtract the 1 ounce he has from the 3 ounces he needs: \(3 - 1 = 2\). This means Quinn needs 2 more ounces of healing herbs. The answer is 2 ounces.

      To find out how many phoenix feathers Casey used, we need to subtract the number of feathers she has left from the number she started with. Casey started with 257 feathers and now has 189 feathers. We subtract 189 from 257 like this: 257 - 189 = 68. So, Casey used 68 feathers. The answer is 68.

      To find out who has more feathers, we need to compare the fractions 3/4 and 2/3. First, we find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 12. We convert 3/4 to 9/12 by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 3. We convert 2/3 to 8/12 by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 4. Since 9/12 is greater than 8/12, Casey has more feathers. The answer is Casey.

      To find out how many feathers are in 5 lines, we need to multiply the number of feathers in each line by the number of lines. Each line has 8 feathers, and there are 5 lines. So, we calculate \(8 \times 5\). When we multiply 8 by 5, we get 40. The answer is 40 feathers.

      To find out how many apples are in the cauldron, we need to add the apples Alex used with the apples Parker added. Alex started with 57 apples, and Parker added 34 more apples. We add these numbers together: 57 + 34. First, add the ones place: 7 + 4 equals 11. Write down 1 and carry over 1 to the tens place. Next, add the tens place: 5 + 3 equals 8, and don't forget to add the 1 we carried over, which makes it 9. So, 57 + 34 equals 91. The answer is 91 apples.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many feathers Hayden will need for the 7th potion, we first look at the pattern: 8, 16, 24. We can see that each number increases by 8. This means the pattern is adding 8 each time. To find the 7th number in the sequence, we start with 8 and add 8 six times: 1st potion: 8 feathers 2nd potion: 8 + 8 = 16 feathers 3rd potion: 16 + 8 = 24 feathers 4th potion: 24 + 8 = 32 feathers 5th potion: 32 + 8 = 40 feathers 6th potion: 40 + 8 = 48 feathers 7th potion: 48 + 8 = 56 feathers The answer is 56 feathers.

The denominators are 8 and 4, and the least common denominator is 8. We can change 1/4 to 2/8 because 1 times 2 is 2 and 4 times 2 is 8. Now we add 3/8 and 2/8, which equals 5/8. The answer is 5/8 gallons.

      Riley needs 47 apples for a potion. She has 29. How many more apples does she need to brew the potion?

    </choices>
    <explanation>
      To find out how many more apples Riley needs, we need to subtract the number of apples she already has from the total number she needs. Start with the total number of apples needed, which is 47, and subtract the number of apples she already has, which is 29. So, we calculate 47 - 29. First, subtract the ones: 7 - 9. Since 7 is smaller than 9, we need to borrow 1 from the tens place. This makes the 7 become 17 and the 4 in the tens place become 3. Now, subtract the ones: 17 - 9 = 8. Next, subtract the tens: 3 - 2 = 1. So, Riley needs 18 more apples. The answer is 18 apples.

    <explanation>
      To compare 3/4 gallon of dragon ink with 5/8 gallon of unicorn tears, we need to find a common denominator. The denominators are 4 and 8, and the least common denominator is 8. We convert 3/4 to 6/8 by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 2. Now we compare 6/8 (dragon ink) with 5/8 (unicorn tears). Since 6/8 is greater than 5/8, the dragon ink is greater. The answer is Dragon ink.

      To find the total fluid ounces of potion in all the vials, we need to add the amounts in each vial together. Start by adding the smallest numbers first: 3 + 5 = 8. Then, add 7 to 8, which equals 15. Next, add 9 to 15, giving us 24. Continue by adding 11 to 24, resulting in 35. Add 13 to 35, which equals 48. Finally, add 15 to 48, and you get 63. The answer is 63 fluid ounces.

      To find out which potion has more healing herbs, we need to compare the fractions 3/4 and 5/8. First, we need to make the denominators the same so we can compare them easily. The least common denominator of 4 and 8 is 8. We can change 3/4 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 8 by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 2. This gives us 6/8. Now we compare 6/8 and 5/8. Since 6/8 is greater than 5/8, 3/4 ounce has more healing herbs. The answer is 3/4 ounce.

      To find out how many healing herbs go into each cauldron, we need to divide the total number of herbs, 72, by the number of cauldrons, which is 8. We do this by performing the division: 72 ÷ 8. When we divide 72 by 8, we find that 8 fits into 72 exactly 9 times. The answer is 9 herbs.

      To find out how many gallons of potion Avery has in total, we need to add the fractions 3/8 and 1/4. First, we need a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 8 and 4, and the least common denominator is 8. We can keep 3/8 as it is, but we need to change 1/4 to have a denominator of 8. We do this by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator of 1/4 by 2, which gives us 2/8. Now we can add the fractions: 3/8 + 2/8 = 5/8. The answer is 5/8 gallons.

      To find out how many vials are on the other side, we need to use multiplication. Blake arranges the vials in a rectangle, so we multiply the number of vials on one side by the number on the other side to get the total. We know there are 12 vials in total and one side has 3 vials. We can set up the equation: 3 vials × ? vials = 12 vials. To find the missing number, we divide 12 by 3, which gives us 4. The answer is 4 vials.

      To find out how many feathers Casey has left, we need to subtract the number of feathers she gave to Blake from the total number of feathers she started with. Casey started with 47 feathers and gave 29 feathers to Blake. We do the subtraction: 47 - 29. First, subtract the ones: 7 - 9. Since 7 is smaller than 9, we need to borrow 1 from the tens place, making it 17 - 9, which equals 8. Now, subtract the tens: 3 - 2, which equals 1. So, 47 - 29 equals 18. The answer is 18 feathers.

We add these numbers together: 47 + 36. First, add the ones place: 7 + 6 equals 13. Write down 3 and carry over 1 to the tens place. Next, add the tens place: 4 + 3 equals 7, plus the 1 we carried over equals 8. So, Alex now has 83 apples. The answer is 83 apples.

      To find out how many whole vials Willow can fill, we need to divide the amount of potion she has, 0.75 cauldron, by the amount each vial can hold, 0.25 cauldron. We can do this by dividing 0.75 by 0.25. When we divide 0.75 by 0.25, we get 3. This means Willow can fill 3 whole vials. The answer is 3 vials.

      To find out how many drops Ocean uses, we need to multiply the number of drops River uses by 3, because Ocean uses 3 times as many drops. River uses 60 drops, so we calculate 60 times 3. The multiplication is: 60 x 3 = 180. The answer is 180 drops.

We subtract Vale's amount from Sage's amount: 90 - 75 = 15. This means Sage has 15 milliliters more than Vale. The answer is Sage, 15 milliliters.

      To solve this problem, imagine a circle with 8 glowing phoenix feathers evenly spaced around it. When you connect each feather to the center, you create 8 equal sections. Since a full circle is 360 degrees, each section is 360 ÷ 8 = 45 degrees. A right angle is 90 degrees, so each 45-degree section is half of a right angle. Therefore, each connection from a feather to the center forms half of a right angle, and with 8 feathers, you have 8 right angles in total. The answer is 8.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many starflower petals Sage needs for 10 potions, we need to multiply the number of petals for one potion by 10. Sage uses 3.5 petals for one potion, so we calculate 3.5 times 10. When we multiply 3.5 by 10, we get 35. The answer is 35 petals.

      To find out how many transformation elixir bottles Cedar has left, we need to subtract the number of bottles he gave to Felix from the total number he originally had. Cedar started with 291 bottles. He gave 75 bottles to Felix. So, we calculate 291 - 75. First, subtract the ones: 1 - 5. Since 1 is smaller than 5, we need to borrow from the tens place. Change the 9 in the tens place to 8, and the 1 in the ones place becomes 11. Now, 11 - 5 equals 6. Next, subtract the tens: 8 - 7 equals 1. Finally, subtract the hundreds: 2 - 0 equals 2. So, Cedar has 216 bottles left. The answer is 216 bottles.

Since 1 liter is equal to 1,000 milliliters, 2 liters is equal to 2,000 milliliters. Ocean needs 500 milliliters for his potion, so we subtract 500 milliliters from 2,000 milliliters: 2,000 - 500 = 1,500. The answer is 1500 milliliters.

      To solve this problem, we need to look at the pattern in the sequence of feathers: 3, 3, 4. First, notice that the sequence starts with two 3s and then a 4. This pattern repeats itself. So, after the number 4, the sequence starts over with two 3s again, followed by another 4. Therefore, the next number in the sequence after 3, 3, 4 is 4. The answer is 4 feathers.

      To find the digit in the tens place of the number 286, we need to look at the number carefully. The number 286 is made up of three digits: 2 in the hundreds place, 8 in the tens place, and 6 in the ones place. The digit in the tens place is the second digit from the right, which is 8. The answer is 8.

      To find out how many potions Ruby can brew, we need to divide the total amount of moonbeam essence she has, which is 298 milliliters, by the amount needed for each potion, which is 6 milliliters. We do this by dividing 298 by 6. When we divide, 298 ÷ 6 equals 49 with a remainder, but since we are only interested in whole potions, Ruby can make 49 complete potions. The answer is 49 potions.

      To find out how Briar can divide 24 pinches of starflower petal dust equally among 3 cauldrons, we need to divide 24 by 3. First, we calculate 24 ÷ 3, which equals 8. This means Briar can put 8 pinches in each cauldron. Another way is to put 8 pinches in each cauldron again, confirming that there are 2 ways to do this: by dividing the dust equally into 3 groups of 8 pinches each. The answer is 2 ways.

      To find out how much more concentrated lightning Jasper needs, we start by subtracting the amount he already has from the total amount he needs. Jasper needs 450 milliliters in total, and he already has 275 milliliters. We calculate 450 - 275 to find the difference. First, subtract the ones: 0 - 5, which requires borrowing. Borrow 1 from the tens, making it 10 - 5 = 5. Next, subtract the tens: 4 (after borrowing) - 7, which requires borrowing again. Borrow 1 from the hundreds, making it 14 - 7 = 7. Finally, subtract the hundreds: 3 - 2 = 1. So, 450 - 275 = 175. The answer is 175 milliliters.

      To find out how many herbs each mortar and pestle grinds, we need to divide the total number of herbs, 296, by the number of mortar and pestles, which is 7. We set up the division problem as 296 ÷ 7. When we divide, 7 goes into 29 four times because 7 times 4 is 28. Subtract 28 from 29, and we have 1 left over. Bring down the 6 to make 16. Then, 7 goes into 16 two times because 7 times 2 is 14. Subtract 14 from 16, and we have 2 left over. So, each mortar and pestle grinds 42 herbs. The answer is 42 herbs.

    <explanation>
      To find out which tonic is greater in volume, we need to compare the two decimal numbers: 0.45 and 0.5. First, look at the tenths place in both numbers. Hazel's tonic has 4 tenths (0.45), and Briar's tonic has 5 tenths (0.5). Since 5 tenths is greater than 4 tenths, Briar's tonic is greater in volume. The answer is Briar's tonic.

    <explanation>
      To find out what fraction of Ocean's amount River has, we need to compare River's 300 milliliters to Ocean's 450 milliliters. First, we write this comparison as a fraction: \(\frac{300}{450}\). Next, we simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor of 300 and 450, which is 150. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 150 gives us \(\frac{300 \div 150}{450 \div 150} = \frac{2}{3}\). The answer is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

    <explanation>
      To find out how many drops each cauldron receives, we need to divide the total number of drops, 297, by the number of cauldrons, which is 3. We start by dividing 297 by 3. First, divide the hundreds place: 2 hundreds divided by 3 is 0, with 2 hundreds left over. Next, combine the leftover 2 hundreds with the 9 tens to make 29 tens. Divide 29 tens by 3, which gives us 9 tens with 2 tens left over. Finally, combine the leftover 2 tens with the 7 ones to make 27 ones. Divide 27 ones by 3, which gives us 9 ones with no remainder. So, each cauldron receives 99 drops. The answer is 99 drops.

      To find out how many levitation tonic containers Willow has left, we need to subtract the number of containers she gave to Aspen from the total number she brewed. Willow started with 293 containers. She gave 157 containers to Aspen. We subtract 157 from 293: \[ 293 - 157 = 136 \] So, Willow has 136 containers left. The answer is 136.

    <explanation>
      To form a rectangle, opposite sides must be equal in length. Vale uses 8 rods in total, and a rectangle has 4 sides. If we divide the 8 rods equally among the 4 sides, each side will have 2 rods. However, since opposite sides are equal, we need to pair the rods into two equal groups. So, we take 8 rods and divide them into 2 groups of 4 rods each. Each group represents the opposite sides of the rectangle. The answer is 4 rods.

      To find out how many pinches Aurora adds in 1 hour, we first need to know how many 15-minute intervals are in 1 hour. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, we divide 60 by 15, which equals 4. This means there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in 1 hour. Aurora adds 45 pinches every 15 minutes, so we multiply 45 by 4 to find the total number of pinches in 1 hour. \(45 \times 4 = 180\). The answer is 180 pinches.

When we divide, we find that 150 goes into 600 exactly 4 times because 150 x 4 = 600. The answer is 4 potions.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many enchanted stirring rods Ocean uses in total, we need to multiply the number of rods she uses per potion by the number of potions she brews. Ocean uses 3 stirring rods for each potion, and she brews 5 potions. So, we multiply 3 rods by 5 potions: 3 × 5 = 15. The answer is 15 enchanted stirring rods.

      To find out who has more alchemical mastery points, we need to compare the fractions 2/3 and 4/6. First, let's see if these fractions are equivalent. We can simplify 4/6 by dividing both the numerator (4) and the denominator (6) by their greatest common factor, which is 2. When we do this, 4 divided by 2 is 2, and 6 divided by 2 is 3, so 4/6 simplifies to 2/3. Since both fractions are equal to 2/3, Felix and Finn have the same amount of mastery points. The answer is They have the same amount.

      To find out how much more concentrated lightning Iris needs, we subtract the amount she already has from the total amount she needs. Start with the total amount, 327 milliliters, and subtract the amount she has, 178 milliliters: \[ 327 - 178 = 149 \] So, Iris needs 149 more milliliters of concentrated lightning. The answer is 149 milliliters.

      To find out how much of the distillation tube Luna uses in total, we need to add the fractions 3/10 and 1/5. First, we need to make sure the fractions have the same denominator. The denominator of 1/5 is 5, and we can change it to 10 by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 2, which gives us 2/10. Now we can add 3/10 and 2/10 together: 3/10 + 2/10 = 5/10. When we simplify 5/10, it becomes 1/2. The answer is 1/2.

      To find out who uses more starflower petal dust, we need to compare the fractions 3/4 and 2/3. First, we find a common denominator for these fractions. The smallest number that both 4 and 3 can divide into is 12. Next, we convert each fraction to have the denominator of 12. For 3/4, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 3 to get 9/12. For 2/3, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 4 to get 8/12. Now we compare the fractions: 9/12 is greater than 8/12. This means Aspen uses more starflower petal dust than Cedar. The answer is Aspen.

    <explanation>
      To find out how much more ethereal powder Willow needs, we need to subtract the amount she already has from the total amount she needs. Willow needs 250 grams in total, and she already has 175 grams. So, we calculate 250 grams - 175 grams. When we subtract 175 from 250, we get 75. This means Willow needs 75 more grams of ethereal powder. The answer is 75 grams.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many units of magical energy Aurora needs, we start by finding 3/4 of 400 units. First, divide 400 by 4, which gives us 100. This tells us how much 1/4 of the potion is. Then, multiply 100 by 3 to find 3/4 of the potion. So, 100 times 3 equals 300. The answer is 300 units.

      To find out how many distillation tubes Vale has now, we need to add the number of tubes he already had to the number Sage gave him. Vale started with 27 distillation tubes, and Sage gave him 38 more. We add these two numbers together: 27 + 38. First, add the ones place: 7 + 8 equals 15. Write down the 5 and carry over the 1 to the tens place. Next, add the tens place: 2 + 3 equals 5, and don't forget to add the 1 you carried over, which makes it 6. So, 27 + 38 equals 65. The answer is 65.

      To find out how many grams are in each part, we need to divide the total amount of powdered unicorn horn by the number of parts. Sage has 75 grams of powdered unicorn horn, and she wants to divide it into 3 equal parts. We do this by dividing 75 by 3. The division looks like this: \( 75 \div 3 = 25 \). So, each part will have 25 grams. The answer is 25 grams.

      To find out if 3/4 and 6/8 are equal, we can compare them by making their denominators the same. The denominator is the bottom number of a fraction. We can change 3/4 to have a denominator of 8 by multiplying both the top number (numerator) and the bottom number (denominator) by 2. This gives us 6/8. Since 6/8 is the same as 6/8, the amounts are equal. The answer is Yes.

      To find out how much magical energy River adds in 30 minutes, we first need to know how many 5-minute intervals are in 30 minutes. We do this by dividing 30 by 5, which equals 6. This means there are 6 intervals of 5 minutes in 30 minutes. Since River adds 120 units of magical energy every 5 minutes, we multiply 120 by 6. So, 120 times 6 equals 720. The answer is 720 units.

      To find out if the potion vials are equivalent in size, we need to compare the fractions 3/4 and 2/4. Both fractions have the same denominator, which is 4, so we can directly compare the numerators. The numerator 3 is greater than 2, which means 3/4 is greater than 2/4. However, the question asks if the potion vials are equivalent in size, not if they are equal. Since both fractions are parts of vials that are divided into 4 equal parts, they are not equivalent in size. The answer is No.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many distillation tubes Vale has now, we need to add the number of tubes he already has to the number Sage gives him. Vale starts with 47 tubes, and Sage gives him 18 more. We add these two numbers together: 47 + 18. First, add the ones place: 7 + 8 equals 15. Write down 5 and carry over 1 to the tens place. Next, add the tens place: 4 + 1 equals 5, and don't forget to add the 1 you carried over, which makes it 6. So, 47 + 18 equals 65. The answer is 65.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many more pinches of starflower petal dust Ivy needs, we start with the total amount she needs, which is 150 pinches. Ivy already has 75 pinches. We subtract the amount she has from the total amount needed: 150 - 75 = 75. This means Ivy needs 75 more pinches to have enough for her potion. The answer is 75 pinches.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many potions Briar can brew, we need to divide the total number of starflower petals, 132, by the number of petals needed for each potion, which is 11. We can do this by setting up the division problem: 132 ÷ 11. When we divide 132 by 11, we find that 11 goes into 132 exactly 12 times. This means Briar can make 12 potions. The answer is 12 potions.

      To find out how many grams of powdered unicorn horn Sage puts in each vial, we need to divide the total amount by the number of vials. Sage has 150 grams of powdered unicorn horn and she wants to divide it equally into 5 vials. We do this by dividing 150 by 5, which is written as \(150 \div 5\). When we divide 150 by 5, we get 30. The answer is 30 grams.

      To find out which ingredient contributes the most to the potion's 3000 units of magical energy, we need to compare the energy each ingredient adds. Let's say dragon scales add 1500 units, phoenix feathers add 1000 units, and unicorn hair adds 500 units. We add these amounts together: 1500 + 1000 + 500 = 3000 units, which matches the total magical energy of the potion. Since dragon scales add 1500 units, which is more than the other ingredients, they contribute the most energy. The answer is Dragon scales.

Write down 6 and carry over 1 to the tens place. Next, add the tens place: 2 + 8 = 10, and add the carried over 1, which makes 11. Write down 1 and carry over 1 to the hundreds place. Finally, add the hundreds place: 1 + 1 = 2. So, 127 + 89 equals 216. The answer is 216.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many pages there are in total, we need to multiply the number of spell scrolls by the number of pages each scroll has. Felix has 10 spell scrolls, and each scroll has 10 pages. So, we multiply 10 (scrolls) by 10 (pages per scroll), which gives us 10 x 10 = 100. The answer is 100 pages.

      To find out how many ounces of starlight essence Aspen has in total, we need to multiply the number of vials by the amount of essence in each vial. Aspen has 3 vials, and each vial contains 4 ounces. So, we can calculate it like this: 3 vials × 4 ounces per vial = 12 ounces. Therefore, Aspen has a total of 12 ounces of starlight essence. The answer is 12 ounces.

    <explanation>
      To find out how much phoenix feather essence Aurora has left after using some, we start with the amount she has, which is 3/4 of a vial. She uses 1/2 of that amount for a potion. First, we need to find out how much 1/2 of 3/4 is. We can do this by multiplying the fractions: 1/2 × 3/4 = 3/8. Now, we subtract the amount she used (3/8) from the amount she started with (3/4). To do this, we need to convert 3/4 to have the same denominator as 3/8. The fraction 3/4 is the same as 6/8. Now we can subtract: 6/8 - 3/8 = 3/8. This means Aurora has 3/8 of a vial left. However, we need to find out how much essence remains after using 1/2 of the 3/4 vial. To clarify, if we take 3/4 and subtract 1/2 of it, we can also think of it as: 3/4 - 1/.

      <choice id="D">
        7/4 or 1 1/4 vials
      </choice>
    </choices>
    <explanation>
      To find out how much mystic powder Vale used in total, we need to add the two fractions together: 3/4 and 1/2. First, we need a common denominator to add these fractions. The number 4 is a common denominator because it can be used for both fractions. Next, we convert 1/2 to a fraction with a denominator of 4. We can do this by multiplying the top and bottom of 1/2 by 2, which gives us 2/4. Now we can add 3/4 and 2/4 together: 3/4 + 2/4 = (3 + 2)/4 = 5/4. This means Vale used a total of 5/4 of a vial, which can also be written as 1 1/4 vials. The answer is 5/4 or 1 1/4 vials.

    <explanation>
      To find out how much feather Clover has after Ivy gives her more, we start with what Clover already has, which is 3/4 of a feather. Ivy gives Clover 1/2 more feather. To add these fractions together, we first need to make sure they have the same denominator. The fraction 1/2 can be changed to a fraction with a denominator of 4. We do this by multiplying the top and bottom of 1/2 by 2, which gives us 2/4. Now we can add 3/4 and 2/4 together: 3/4 + 2/4 = 5/4. Since 5/4 is an improper fraction, we can convert it to a mixed number. This means we have 1 whole feather and 1/4 left over, which we write as 1 1/4. The answer is 1 1/4 feathers.

      To find out how much elixir Finn has left after using some, we start with the amount he has, which is 3/4 of a bottle. Finn uses 1/2 of what he has. To subtract these fractions, we first need to change 1/2 into a fraction with the same denominator as 3/4. Since 1/2 is the same as 2/4, we can now subtract: 3/4 - 2/4 = 1/4. This means Finn has 1/4 of a bottle of elixir remaining after using some. The answer is 1/4 bottle of elixir.

      To find out how much potion Luna can brew, we need to add the fractions of the phoenix feathers and dragon tears she has. First, we write the fractions: Luna has 3/4 of a vial of phoenix feathers and 1/2 of a vial of dragon tears. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator of 4 and 2 is 4. Next, we convert 1/2 to a fraction with a denominator of 4. Since 1/2 is the same as 2/4, we can now add 3/4 and 2/4 together. Now we add the numerators: 3 + 2 = 5. So, we have 5/4 vials in total. The answer is 5/4 vials.

Then, we need to subtract the number of bottles she gives away, which is 3. So, we do the math: 8 (original bottles) - 3 (bottles given to Rowan) = 5. This means Briar has 5 elixir bottles left. The answer is 5 elixir bottles.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many ounces of starlight essence Storm has in total, we need to multiply the number of vials by the amount of essence in each vial. Storm has 3 vials, and each vial holds 4 ounces. So, we calculate: 3 vials × 4 ounces per vial = 12 ounces. This means Storm has a total of 12 ounces of starlight essence. The answer is 12 ounces.

      To find out how many total ingredients Finn needs for his potion, we need to add the number of dragon tears and phoenix feathers together. Finn requires 3 dragon tears and 4 phoenix feathers. We can write this as a math problem: 3 (dragon tears) + 4 (phoenix feathers) = 7 (total ingredients). So, when we add 3 and 4, we get 7. The answer is 7 ingredients.

    <explanation>
      To write the number 286 in expanded form, we need to break it down into its place values. The number 286 has three digits: 2, 8, and 6. The 2 is in the hundreds place, which means it represents 200. The 8 is in the tens place, which means it represents 80. Finally, the 6 is in the ones place, which means it represents 6. So, when we add these values together, we get 200 + 80 + 6. The answer is 200 + 80 + 6.

      To find out how many unicorn tears Cedar has left after using some for a potion, we need to subtract the number of tears he used from the total he collected.

Next, we subtract the tens place: 3 - 9. Since we can't take 9 from 3, we need to borrow 1 from the hundreds place, making it 2. Now we have 13 - 9 = 4. Finally, we subtract the hundreds place: 2 - 2 = 0. Putting it all together, we find that 1,234 - 291 = 943. The answer is 943 tears.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many phoenix feathers Felix has now, we need to add the feathers he already has to the feathers he found. First, we start with the 5 feathers he has. Then, we add the 7 feathers he found. So, we can write it as: 5 (his feathers) + 7 (the feathers he found) = 12. Now, we see that Felix has a total of 12 phoenix feathers. The answer is 12 phoenix feathers.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many potions Ruby can create with 298 drops of starlight essence, we need to divide the total number of drops by the number of drops needed for each potion. Ruby uses 6 drops for each potion. First, we divide 298 by 6. When we do the division, we find that 298 divided by 6 equals 49 with a remainder. This means Ruby can make 49 complete potions, and she will have some drops left over that are not enough to make another potion. The answer is 49 potions.

      To find out how long it will take Sage to heat all 5 cauldrons, we need to multiply the number of cauldrons by the time it takes to heat each one. Each cauldron takes 4 minutes, and there are 5 cauldrons. So, we calculate: 5 cauldrons × 4 minutes per cauldron = 20 minutes. This means it will take a total of 20 minutes to heat all the cauldrons. The answer is 20 minutes.

      To find out how much phoenix feather essence Ivy has after Wren gives her more, we start with the amount Ivy already has, which is 3/4 of a vial. Wren gives Ivy 1/2 of a vial more. First, we need to add 3/4 and 1/2 together. To do this, we can convert 1/2 into a fraction that has the same denominator as 3/4. The denominator of 3/4 is 4, so we convert 1/2 to 2/4 (because 1/2 is the same as 2/4). Now we can add the two fractions: 3/4 + 2/4 = 5/4. Since 5/4 is an improper fraction, we can convert it to a mixed number. 5/4 is the same as 1 whole and 1/4. Therefore, Ivy now has 1 1/4 vials of phoenix feather essence. The answer is 1 1/4 vials.

      To find out how much of the vial of glowing herbs Wren has after adding more, we start with the amount she already has, which is 3/4 of a vial. Next, we need to add 1/8 of a vial to that. To do this, we first need a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 4 and 8. The least common denominator is 8. We can convert 3/4 to eighths by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 2, which gives us 6/8. Now we can add 6/8 and 1/8 together: 6/8 + 1/8 = 7/8. So, Wren now has 7/8 of a vial of glowing herbs. The answer is 7/8 vial.

First, we start with the total number of drops, which is 327. Then, we subtract the 123 drops she used for the potion. The calculation looks like this: 327 - 123 = 204. So, after using 123 drops, Iris has 204 drops remaining. The answer is 204 drops.

      To find out how many phoenix feathers Luna has left after giving some to Aurora, we need to subtract the number of feathers she gave away from the number she originally had. Luna starts with 290 phoenix feathers and gives away 45 feathers. We can write this as a subtraction problem: 290 - 45 = ? Now, let's do the subtraction step by step. First, we can break it down: 290 - 40 = 250 (subtracting 40) 250 - 5 = 245 (then subtracting 5) So, after giving away 45 feathers, Luna has 245 phoenix feathers left. The answer is 245.

      To find out how much liquid is in the cauldron after Felix adds more, we start with the amount he already has, which is 3/4 of a cauldron. Next, we need to add 1/8 of a cauldron to this amount. First, we need a common denominator to add these fractions. The denominators are 4 and 8. The common denominator is 8. We can change 3/4 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 8. To do this, we multiply the top and bottom of 3/4 by 2, which gives us 6/8. Now we can add 6/8 and 1/8 together: 6/8 + 1/8 = 7/8. So, after adding the extra liquid, there is now 7/8 of a cauldron in total. The answer is 7/8 cauldron.

      To find out how much liquid shadow remains after Briar uses some, we start with the total amount he needs, which is 1,250 milliliters. Then, we subtract the amount he has already used, which is 750 milliliters. We can write this as a subtraction problem: 1,250 - 750 = 500. So, after using 750 milliliters, Briar has 500 milliliters left. The answer is 500 milliliters.

    </choices>
    <explanation>
      To find out how many cauldron bubbles there are in total, we need to add the two amounts together. Clover has 3/4 of a cauldron of bubbles, and Ivy adds 1/2 more. First, we need to make the fractions have the same denominator. The number 4 is the least common denominator for 4 and 2. Now, we can change 1/2 to a fraction with a denominator of 4. Since 1/2 is the same as 2/4, we can add 3/4 and 2/4 together. So, 3/4 + 2/4 = 5/4. This fraction is an improper fraction, which means we can also write it as a mixed number. 5/4 is the same as 1 whole and 1/4. Therefore, the total number of cauldron bubbles is 1 1/4. The answer is 1 1/4 cauldron bubbles.

      To solve the problem, we need to understand what a cauldron looks like. A cauldron is a pot that is usually round and has straight sides. When we think about its shape, we can see that it is like a cylinder, which is a 3D shape with two flat circles on the top and bottom and straight sides connecting them. Therefore, since the cauldron is shaped like a cylinder, we can confidently say that the answer is Cylinder.

Since there are 3 powders and each one weighs 4 grams, we can use multiplication to make this easier. We multiply the number of powders (3) by the weight of each powder (4 grams): 3 × 4 = 12 grams. So, the total weight of the powders is 12 grams. The answer is 12 grams.

      To find out how many magical ingredients Briar has left after using some for a potion, we need to subtract the number of ingredients she used from the total she had. Briar started with 1,234 ingredients and used 567 for the potion. We can set up the subtraction like this: 1,234 - 567 = 667. So, after using the ingredients, Briar has 667 ingredients remaining. The answer is 667 ingredients.

      To find out how many potions Hazel can make with her 12 phoenix feathers, we need to divide the total number of feathers by the number of feathers needed for each potion. Hazel uses 4 feathers for each potion. We can set up the division like this: 12 divided by 4. When we do the math, we find that 12 divided by 4 equals 3. This means Hazel can make 3 potions with her 12 feathers. The answer is 3 potions.

    <explanation>
      To find out how full Clover's cauldron is after adding more potion, we start with what she already has, which is 3/4 of a cauldron. Then, she adds 1/4 more. Now, we need to add these two fractions together: 3/4 + 1/4. Since the denominators (the bottom numbers) are the same, we can simply add the numerators (the top numbers): 3 + 1 = 4. So, we have 4/4, which means the cauldron is now full. When we have 4/4, it is the same as 1 whole. The answer is 1 whole cauldron.

      In the mystical laboratory, the cauldrons that hold the potions are shaped like circles. This means they are round, which helps the potions mix evenly when heated by the magic flames. Since circles have no corners and are smooth all around, we can say that the cauldrons are in a round shape. The answer is Round shape.

Now we can do 12 - 7, which equals 5. Next, we subtract the tens place: 5 - 8 cannot be done, so we borrow again from the hundreds place, changing 4 to 3 and making the 5 into 15. Now, 15 - 8 equals 7. Finally, we subtract the hundreds place: 3 - 1 equals 2. Putting it all together, we find that 462 - 187 equals 275. The answer is 275 v.

      To find out how many healing herbs Skylar has left after using some for potions, we need to subtract the number of herbs he used from the total he collected. Skylar started with 1,245 herbs and used 378 of them. We can set up the subtraction like this: 1,245 - 378 = ? Now, let's do the subtraction step by step. First, we subtract the ones: 5 - 8 cannot be done, so we need to borrow from the tens place. This makes it 15 - 8, which equals 7. Next, we subtract the tens: 3 (after borrowing, it becomes 2) from 4, which equals 1. Finally, we subtract the hundreds: 1 - 0 equals 1. Putting it all together, we find that 1,245 - 378 equals 867. The answer is 867 herbs.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many phoenix feathers Rowan has in total, we start with the number of feathers he already has, which is 12. Then, we add the 7 feathers that Zara gives him. We can write this as a math equation: 12 + 7 = 19. So, when we add 12 feathers and 7 feathers together, Rowan ends up with 19 feathers. The answer is 19 feathers.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many potions Morgan can make, we need to divide the total number of herbs he collected by the number of herbs needed for each potion. Morgan has 12 healing herbs and he uses 3 herbs for each potion. We can set up the division like this: 12 (total herbs) ÷ 3 (herbs per potion) = 4 (potions). This means Morgan can make 4 potions with the herbs he collected. The answer is 4 potions.

      Blake and Nova are measuring the length of their classroom. Blake measures the length and finds it to be 24 feet, while Nova measures the width and finds it to be 18 feet. What is the total perimeter of the classroom in feet?

      <choice id="D">
        168 feet
      </choice>
    </choices>
    <explanation>
      To find the total perimeter of the classroom, we first need to remember that the perimeter is the distance all around the shape. Since Blake measured the length as 24 feet and Nova measured the width as 18 feet, we can use this formula: 

Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width). 

Now, let's do the math: 

1. Add the length and width: 24 feet + 18 feet = 42 feet.
2. Now, multiply that sum by 2: 42 feet × 2 = 84 feet.

So, the total perimeter of the classroom is 84 feet! Great job using the formula to find the answer! You can feel confident that you did it right!

      To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula: Perimeter = 2 × (length + width). In this case, the length is 7 units and the width is 3 units. So, we first add 7 and 3 together, which equals 10, and then multiply by 2, giving us 20 units for the perimeter. This means if you walked all the way around the rectangle, you would travel 20 units!

      </choice>
    </choices>
    <explanation>
      To find the area of Jayden's rectangular banner, we multiply the length (4 feet) by the width (2 feet), which gives us 4 x 2 = 8 square feet. For Fatima's square banner, we multiply the side length (3 feet) by itself, so 3 x 3 = 9 square feet. Since 9 square feet is more than 8 square feet, Fatima's banner is larger than Jayden's banner!

        Aria's design has an area of 24 square feet, while Ethan's design has an area of 9 square feet.
      </choice>
    </choices>
    <explanation>
      To find the area of Aria's rectangle, we multiply the length (4 feet) by the width (3 feet): 4 x 3 = 12 square feet. For Ethan's square, we multiply the length of one side (3 feet) by itself: 3 x 3 = 9 square feet. So, Aria's design has a bigger area of 12 square feet compared to Ethan's 9 square feet!
