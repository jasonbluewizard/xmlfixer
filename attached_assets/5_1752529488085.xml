    <explanation>
      In geometry, a vertex is a point where two or more edges meet. A cube, like Vial A, has vertices because it has edges that meet at corners. A cylinder, like Vial B, has edges at the top and bottom, but no vertices because the edges are curved and do not meet at a point. A sphere, like Vial C, is completely round and smooth, with no edges or vertices at all. The answer is Vial C.

    <explanation>
      To determine the shape of the cauldron's base, we need to consider the information given. Morgan arranges the healing herbs in a cauldron where each side measures 3 feet. In geometry, if all four sides of a shape are equal in length, the shape is a square. Since each side of the cauldron's base is 3 feet, it confirms that the base is a square. The answer is Square shape.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many vials are in each row, we need to understand the arrangement of the vials in a grid. Taylor has arranged the 24 vials in a 6x4 grid, which means there are 6 rows and 4 columns. Each row contains the same number of vials as the number of columns. Therefore, since there are 4 columns, each row has 4 vials. The answer is 4 vials.

      Alex brews a potion using 3 gallons of apple juice. If each apple yields 8 fluid ounces, how many apples does Alex need?

    <choices>
      <choice id="A">
        96 apples

      <choice id="D">
        43 apples
      </choice>
    </choices>
    <explanation>
      To solve this problem, we need to convert the 3 gallons of apple juice into fluid ounces because each apple yields 8 fluid ounces. Since 1 gallon equals 128 fluid ounces, 3 gallons will be 3 x 128 = 384 fluid ounces. Next, we divide the total fluid ounces by the amount each apple yields: 384 ÷ 8 = 48. The answer is 48 apples.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many ounces of apples Riley uses in total, we need to multiply the number of apples by the weight of each apple. Riley uses 45 apples, and each apple weighs 4 ounces. So, we calculate \(45 \times 4\). First, multiply 45 by 4: \[ 45 \times 4 = 180 \] This means Riley uses 180 ounces of apples in total. The answer is 180 ounces.

    <explanation>
      To write the number 34.5 in word form, we start by looking at the whole number part, which is 34. We write this as "thirty-four." Next, we look at the decimal part, which is 0.5. The digit 5 is in the tenths place, so we write it as "five-tenths." Therefore, when we combine these, we get "thirty-four and five-tenths." The answer is Thirty-four and five-tenths ounces.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many more pounds of phoenix feathers Hayden needs, we need to subtract the amount Taylor gave him from the total amount Hayden needs. Hayden needs 3/4 of a pound, and Taylor gave him 1/2 of a pound. To subtract these fractions, we first need a common denominator. The common denominator for 4 and 2 is 4, so we convert 1/2 to 2/4. Now we can subtract: 3/4 - 2/4 = 1/4. The answer is 1/4 pounds.

      To find out how many gallons of apple juice are in the cauldron, we need to add the amount of apple juice Riley used with the amount River added. Riley used 5.25 gallons, and River added 3.75 gallons. To add these, we line up the decimal points and add the numbers: 5.25 + 3.75 ------ 9.00 When we add 5.25 and 3.75, we get 9.00 gallons. Therefore, the total amount of apple juice in the cauldron is 9 gallons. The answer is 9 gallons.

      To find how many ounces Morgan will mix in the 6th step, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence. The sequence is 4 ounces, 8 ounces, 12 ounces. We can see that each step increases by 4 ounces. So, we add 4 ounces to each previous step to find the next one. Starting from 4 ounces, the sequence is: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and finally 24 ounces in the 6th step. The answer is 24 ounces.

      To find out how many vials Blake uses, we need to calculate 3/4 of 12. We do this by multiplying 12 by 3/4: \(12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 9\). This means Blake uses 9 vials for the potion. To find out how many vials are left unused, we subtract the 9 used vials from the total 12 vials: \(12 - 9 = 3\). The answer is 3 vials.

      To find out how many fluid ounces of potion Blake has in total, we need to multiply the number of vials by the amount each vial holds. Blake has 5 vials, and each vial holds 10 fluid ounces. We calculate this by multiplying 5 (the number of vials) by 10 (the fluid ounces per vial). So, 5 multiplied by 10 equals 50. The answer is 50 fluid ounces.

      To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence of numbers: 5, 10, 15, 20. Each number increases by 5, which means this is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 5. To find the next number in the sequence, we add 5 to the last number, 20. So, 20 + 5 equals 25. The answer is 25 feathers.

      To find out how much more healing herbs Quinn needs, we need to subtract the amount he has from the amount he needs. Quinn needs \( \frac{3}{4} \) cup of herbs, and he currently has \( \frac{1}{2} \) cup. First, we need to make sure the fractions have the same denominator. We can convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to \( \frac{2}{4} \) because \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \). Now, subtract \( \frac{2}{4} \) from \( \frac{3}{4} \): \[ \frac{3}{4} - \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \] So, Quinn needs \( \frac{1}{4} \) cup more of healing herbs. The answer is \( \frac{1}{4} \) cups.

      To find out how many pounds of phoenix feathers Taylor uses, we need to multiply the amount Hayden uses by 2. Hayden uses \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a pound, so we calculate \( 2 \times \frac{3}{4} \). This is done by multiplying the whole number 2 by the numerator 3, which gives us 6, and keeping the denominator 4. Therefore, \( \frac{6}{4} \) simplifies to \( 1 \frac{1}{2} \) pounds because 6 divided by 4 equals 1 with a remainder of 2, which is written as \( \frac{1}{2} \). The answer is 1 1/2 pounds.

      To round 47.386 ounces to the nearest tenth, we need to look at the digit in the hundredths place, which is 8. Since 8 is greater than or equal to 5, we round up the digit in the tenths place from 3 to 4. Therefore, 47.386 rounded to the nearest tenth is 47.4. The answer is 47.4 ounces.

      To find out how many total ounces of phoenix feathers Hayden has, we need to multiply the number of cauldrons by the amount each cauldron holds. Hayden has 3 cauldrons, and each cauldron holds 15 ounces of phoenix feathers. We calculate this by multiplying 3 (cauldrons) by 15 (ounces per cauldron), which equals 45 ounces. The answer is 45 ounces.

First, look at the whole number part, which is 1,234 for both Iris and Luna, so they are the same. Next, compare the decimal parts: Iris has 0.56, and Luna has 0.65. Since 65 is greater than 56, Luna has more points. The answer is Luna.

      To find out how many batches Aspen needs, we need to divide the total amount of powdered unicorn horn required, which is 150 grams, by the amount each batch contains, which is 30 grams. We set up the division problem as 150 ÷ 30. When we divide 150 by 30, we get 5. This means Aspen needs to brew 5 batches to have enough powdered unicorn horn for the potion. The answer is 5 batches.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many glowing phoenix feathers Sage and Iris have together, we need to add the fractions \( \frac{3}{4} \) and \( \frac{2}{5} \). First, we find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 20. We convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) to \( \frac{15}{20} \) and \( \frac{2}{5} \) to \( \frac{8}{20} \). Next, we add these fractions: \( \frac{15}{20} + \frac{8}{20} = \frac{23}{20} \). Since \( \frac{23}{20} \) is an improper fraction, we can also express it as the mixed number \( 1 \frac{3}{20} \). The answer is 23/20 or 1 3/20.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many times stronger Aspen's total potion is compared to Cedar's, we first need to determine the potency of each of Aspen's flasks. Each flask is 4 times stronger than Cedar's, and Aspen has 3 flasks. So, we multiply the strength of one flask by the number of flasks: \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \). This means Aspen's total potion is 12 times stronger than Cedar's. The answer is 12 times stronger.

      To round 47.386 to the nearest tenth, we first identify the tenths place, which is the first digit to the right of the decimal point. In 47.386, the tenths digit is 3. Next, we look at the digit in the hundredths place, which is the second digit to the right of the decimal point. Here, the hundredths digit is 8. Since 8 is 5 or greater, we round the tenths digit up from 3 to 4. Therefore, 47.386 rounded to the nearest tenth is 47.4. The answer is 47.4 pinches.

This gives us 600 × 1/4 = 150 milliliters. Next, we subtract the 150 milliliters she used from the original 600 milliliters: 600 - 150 = 450 milliliters. The answer is 450 milliliters.

      To find the number of grams in the hundreds place of 369 grams, we need to look at the digits of the number. The number 369 has three digits: 3, 6, and 9. The digit in the hundreds place is the first digit, which is 3. This means there are 300 grams in the hundreds place because 3 hundreds equal 300 grams. The answer is 300 grams.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many drops of liquid time are in each cauldron, we need to divide the total number of drops, 370, by the number of cauldrons, which is 10. When we divide 370 by 10, we can think of it as dividing each digit by 10. The number 370 can be split into 370 ÷ 10 = 37, because dividing by 10 shifts each digit one place to the right. Therefore, each cauldron will have 37 drops. The answer is 37 drops.

Briar earned 1,200 points last month and 800 points this month, so we add these together: 1,200 + 800 = 2,000 points. Next, we subtract the total points Briar has from the goal of 3,000 points: 3,000 - 2,000 = 1,000 points. The answer is 1,000 points.

      To find out how many arcane flame sources Briar uses in total, we need to multiply the number of arcane flame sources used per potion by the number of potions he brews. Since Briar uses 3 arcane flame sources for each potion and he brews 4 potions, we calculate \(3 \times 4\). This multiplication gives us 12, which means Briar uses 12 arcane flame sources in total. The answer is 12.

      To find out how much herb each mortar and pestle grinds, we need to divide the total amount of herb, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \), by the number of mortar and pestles, which is 3. This is done by dividing the fraction \( \frac{2}{3} \) by 3. When dividing a fraction by a whole number, you multiply the denominator of the fraction by the whole number. So, \( \frac{2}{3} \div 3 = \frac{2}{3 \times 3} = \frac{2}{9} \). The answer is \( \frac{2}{9} \).

      To find out how much more potion Jasper used than Clover, we need to subtract the fraction Clover used from the fraction Jasper used. Jasper used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a cauldron, and Clover used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a cauldron. First, we convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4, which is \( \frac{2}{4} \). Now, subtract \( \frac{2}{4} \) from \( \frac{3}{4} \): \[ \frac{3}{4} - \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \] So, Jasper used \( \frac{1}{4} \) more of a cauldron than Clover. The answer is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a cauldron.

If Ruby removes 1 row, she takes away 6 flasks because each row has 6 flasks. To find out how many flasks remain, subtract the 6 flasks from the original 24 flasks: 24 - 6 = 18. The answer is 18 flasks.

      To find the total number of drops Luna has, we need to add the two amounts together. Start by aligning the decimal points and adding the numbers: 32.5 + 18.75. Since 32.5 is the same as 32.50, it helps to write it as 32.50 to match the decimal places. Now, add the numbers column by column starting from the right: 0 + 5 = 5 5 + 7 = 12 (write 2 and carry over 1) 2 + 8 + 1 = 11 (write 1 and carry over 1) 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 So, the total is 51.25 drops. The answer is 51.25 drops.

      To find out how many bottles Ivy has left, we first need to determine how many bottles she used. Ivy uses \( \frac{2}{3} \) of her 15 bottles. To find \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 15, multiply 15 by \( \frac{2}{3} \): \[ 15 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{30}{3} = 10. \] This means Ivy used 10 bottles. To find out how many bottles are left, subtract the 10 bottles she used from the original 15 bottles: \[ 15 - 10 = 5. \] The answer is 5 bottles.

      To find the total units of magical energy used by Sage, we need to multiply the number of cauldrons by the amount of magical energy each cauldron holds. Sage uses 3 cauldrons, and each cauldron holds 150 units of magical energy. So, we calculate \(3 \times 150 = 450\). The answer is 450 units.

      To find what fraction of the potion is phoenix feathers, we first need to determine the total number of parts in the potion. Sage mixes 4 parts dragon scales and 3 parts phoenix feathers, so the total number of parts is \(4 + 3 = 7\). The potion has 3 parts phoenix feathers out of a total of 7 parts. Therefore, the fraction of the potion that is phoenix feathers is \( \frac{3}{7} \). The answer is \( \frac{3}{7} \).

      To find out how many total alchemical mastery points Willow earns, we need to multiply the number of potions she brews by the points each potion earns. Willow brews 3 potions, and each potion earns her 250 points. So, we calculate \(3 \times 250\). First, multiply 3 by 250: \[ 3 \times 250 = 750 \] Therefore, Willow earns a total of 750 alchemical mastery points. The answer is 750 points.

      To find the sum of the interior angles of a shape formed by 8 crystal essence extractors arranged in a circle, we first need to determine the type of polygon they form. An 8-sided polygon is called an octagon. The formula to find the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is \((n - 2) \times 180\), where \(n\) is the number of sides. For an octagon, \(n = 8\), so the calculation is \((8 - 2) \times 180 = 6 \times 180 = 1080\). The answer is 1080 degrees.

      To find out how many units of magical energy each potion contains, we need to divide the total number of units, 384, by the number of potions, which is 6. We perform the division: 384 ÷ 6. First, divide 38 by 6, which goes 6 times because 6 x 6 = 36. Subtract 36 from 38 to get a remainder of 2. Bring down the next digit, 4, to make 24. Divide 24 by 6, which goes 4 times because 6 x 4 = 24. Subtract 24 from 24 to get a remainder of 0. Therefore, each potion contains 64 units of magical energy. The answer is 64 units.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many full batches Ocean can brew, we need to divide the total amount of concentrated lightning needed, 1,149 milliliters, by the amount in each batch, 383 milliliters. We perform the division: 1,149 ÷ 383. When we divide, 383 goes into 1,149 exactly 3 times because 383 × 3 = 1,149. Therefore, Ocean can make 3 full batches. The answer is 3 batches.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many milliliters of moonbeam essence are in each potion, we need to divide the total amount of moonbeam essence, which is 24 milliliters, by the number of potions, which is 6. This can be written as the division problem 24 ÷ 6. When we divide 24 by 6, we get 4. This means each potion contains 4 milliliters of moonbeam essence. The answer is 4 milliliters.

      Elara arranges her 24 vials of liquid shadow into a grid with 4 rows and 6 columns. To find out how many vials are in each row, we need to look at the number of columns, because each column represents the number of vials in one row. Since there are 6 columns, each row contains 6 vials. The answer is 6 vials.

      To find the next number in the sequence 4, 1, 5, we need to look for a pattern. Notice that the sequence alternates between subtracting 3 and adding 4. Starting with 4, we subtract 3 to get 1, then add 4 to get 5. Following this pattern, we subtract 3 from 5 to find the next number. Therefore, 5 minus 3 equals 2. However, the sequence given in the problem suggests that the next number after 5 should be 1, indicating a repeating cycle of 4, 1, 5. The answer is 1.

      To determine the shape represented by the potion vial contents, we need to look at the number of drops in each vial. Hazel has 3 vials, each with 4 drops. If we arrange these drops in rows, we can form a shape. By placing 4 drops in each of the 3 rows, we create a shape with 3 rows and 4 columns. This arrangement forms a rectangle because rectangles have opposite sides that are equal in length. The answer is Rectangle.

      To find the fraction of the bottles that are blue, we first need to determine the total number of bottles. Jasper has 8 red, 8 blue, and 8 green bottles, so we add these numbers together: 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 bottles in total. Next, we look at the number of blue bottles, which is 8. To find the fraction of the bottles that are blue, we divide the number of blue bottles by the total number of bottles: 8/24. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8. This gives us 1/3. The answer is 1/3.

      To find the distance between the two points (3, 2) and (7, 5) on a grid, we can use the distance formula, which is based on the Pythagorean theorem. First, calculate the difference in the x-coordinates: 7 - 3 = 4. Then, find the difference in the y-coordinates: 5 - 2 = 3. Next, use these differences to form a right triangle and apply the Pythagorean theorem: \( \sqrt{(4^2) + (3^2)} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \). The answer is 5 units.

      To find the next number in the sequence, we need to identify the pattern. The sequence given is 3, 4, 3. We notice that the numbers alternate between 3 and 4. After the first 3, there is a 4, and then another 3 follows. Therefore, the next number after 3 should be 4, continuing the alternating pattern. The answer is 4.

    <explanation>
      To find the sum of the interior angles of a regular octagon, we can use the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon, which is \((n - 2) \times 180\) degrees, where \(n\) is the number of sides. For an octagon, \(n = 8\). So, we calculate \((8 - 2) \times 180 = 6 \times 180 = 1080\) degrees. The answer is 1080 degrees.

      To find out how much of the potion recipe River has in total, we need to add the fractions from each grimoire. Each grimoire contains \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the potion recipe, and River has 3 grimoires. We can add these fractions by multiplying the fraction \( \frac{1}{4} \) by 3, which is the same as adding \( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} \). This gives us \( \frac{3}{4} \) because multiplying the numerator 1 by 3 results in 3, while the denominator 4 stays the same. The answer is \( \frac{3}{4} \).

      To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence of numbers: 4, 1, 7. First, we find the differences between consecutive numbers: 1 - 4 = -3 and 7 - 1 = 6. The pattern involves subtracting 3 and then adding 6. Continuing this pattern, we subtract 3 from 7 to get 4, and then add 6 to 4 to get 10. Finally, subtract 3 from 10 to get 7, and add 6 to 7 to get 13. Therefore, the next number in the sequence after 7 is 12. The answer is 12.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many grams of powdered unicorn horn Ruby needs, we need to multiply 23 grams by 4. This is because she needs 4 times the amount of 23 grams. We can set up the multiplication as 23 x 4. First, multiply 4 by 3, which equals 12. Write down the 2 and carry over the 1. Next, multiply 4 by 2, which equals 8, and then add the 1 you carried over, giving you 9. So, 23 x 4 equals 92. The answer is 92 grams.

      To find how many tens and ones are in the number 45, we need to look at the place value of each digit. The digit '4' is in the tens place, which means it represents 4 tens, or 40. The digit '5' is in the ones place, which means it represents 5 ones, or 5. Therefore, the number 45 is made up of 4 tens and 5 ones. The answer is 4 tens, 5 ones.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many milliliters of concentrated lightning Cedar needs, we multiply the original amount by 3. Cedar originally uses 450 milliliters, so we calculate \(450 \times 3\). Performing the multiplication, we have \(450 \times 3 = 1350\). Therefore, Cedar needs a total of 1350 milliliters of concentrated lightning for his potion. The answer is 1350 milliliters.

      To find the total magical energy in the cauldron, we need to add the two amounts of magical energy together. Start by aligning the decimal points of 123.45 and 67.89, then add each column starting from the right. Add the hundredths place: 5 + 9 = 14, write down 4 and carry over 1. Next, add the tenths place: 4 + 8 = 12, plus the carried over 1 makes 13, write down 3 and carry over 1. Add the ones place: 3 + 7 = 10, plus the carried over 1 makes 11, write down 1 and carry over 1. Add the tens place: 2 + 6 = 8, plus the carried over 1 makes 9. Finally, add the hundreds place: 1 + 0 = 1. The total magical energy is 191.34 units. The answer is 191.34 units.

      To find the total magical energy used by Sage, we need to add the energy from all three cauldrons together. Start by adding the energy from the first two cauldrons: 250 units plus 375 units equals 625 units. Then, add the energy from the third cauldron: 625 units plus 475 units equals 1100 units. The answer is 1100 units.

    <explanation>
      To write 2,500 in scientific notation, we need to express it as a number between 1 and 10 multiplied by a power of 10. First, we move the decimal point in 2,500 three places to the left to get 2.5. This means we multiply 2.5 by \(10^3\) because moving the decimal three places to the left is the same as dividing by 1,000, which is \(10^3\). The answer is \(2.5 \times 10^3\).

      To find the total number of drops in the potion, we need to add the number of drops Hazel used with the number of drops Briar added. Start by aligning the decimal points of the numbers 45.67 and 12.3, which can be written as 12.30 to make the addition easier. Add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit. First, add the hundredths: 7 + 0 = 7. Next, add the tenths: 6 + 3 = 9. Then, add the ones: 5 + 2 = 7. Finally, add the tens: 4 + 1 = 5. Therefore, the total number of drops in the potion is 57.97. The answer is 57.97 drops.

      To find the total magical energy in the potion, we need to add the two amounts of magical energy together: 123.45 units and 678.9 units. First, align the numbers by their decimal points, ensuring that each digit is in the correct place value column. Then, add the numbers starting from the rightmost digit (the hundredths place), moving to the left. Here is the addition: ``` 123.45 + 678.90 -------- 802.35 ``` After adding each column, we find that the total magical energy in the potion is 802.35 units. The answer is 802.35 units.

      To find the total energy of the potion, we need to add the magical energy from all three cauldrons together. Each cauldron contains 1200 units of magical energy. We can calculate the total energy by multiplying the energy in one cauldron by the number of cauldrons: \( 1200 \times 3 = 3600 \). Therefore, the total energy of the potion is 3600 units. The answer is 3600 units.

    <explanation>
      To find the measure of each central angle when 8 crystal essence extractors are arranged in a circle, we start by knowing that a full circle measures 360 degrees. Since there are 8 extractors, we divide the total degrees of the circle by the number of extractors: 360 degrees ÷ 8 extractors = 45 degrees per extractor. Therefore, each central angle formed by the extractors measures 45 degrees. The answer is 45 degrees.

    <explanation>
      To solve the problem, we first need to understand that the temperature increase is proportional to the time taken. Since it takes Sage 5 minutes to heat the cauldron to 100 degrees, we can see that reaching 200 degrees would require double the time because 200 degrees is twice as hot as 100 degrees. Therefore, we multiply the time it takes to reach 100 degrees by 2: 5 minutes × 2 = 10 minutes. The answer is 10 minutes.

After performing the subtraction, we find that Luna has 308 feathers remaining. The answer is 308 feathers.

We can convert 1/2 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 4 by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 2, giving us 2/4. Now we can add the two fractions: 3/4 + 2/4 = 5/4. This means Ember used a total of 5/4 of a vial of mystic powder. The answer is 5/4.

Sage has 3 vials of phoenix feathers and 4 vials of dragon tears. We can write this as an addition problem: 3 (phoenix feathers) + 4 (dragon tears) = 7 (total vials). Therefore, when we combine these amounts, we find that Sage has 7 vials in total. The answer is 7 vials.

      To find out how much potion is in the cauldron after Briar adds more bubbles, we start with Hazel's 3/4 cauldron bubbles and then add the 1/2 cauldron bubbles that Briar contributes. First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions 3/4 and 1/2. The common denominator is 4, so we can convert 1/2 into fourths, which is 2/4. Now we can add the two fractions: 3/4 + 2/4 = 5/4. Since 5/4 is an improper fraction, we can convert it to a mixed number. This gives us 1 whole and 1/4, which is written as 1 1/4. The answer is 1 1/4 cauldron bubbles.

    <explanation>
      To find out how much of the phoenix feather remains after Felix uses some for a potion, we start with the amount he has, which is 3/4 of a feather. He uses 1/2 of that amount, so we need to subtract 1/2 of 3/4 from 3/4. First, we calculate 1/2 of 3/4 by multiplying the fractions: 1/2 × 3/4 = 3/8. Now, we subtract this amount from the original 3/4: 3/4 - 3/8. To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator of 4 and 8 is 8. We convert 3/4 to eighths: 3/4 = 6/8. Now we can subtract: 6/8 - 3/8 = 3/8. This means Felix has 3/8 of a feather remaining. However, we need to find out how much is left after using 1/2 of the original amount. Since he used 1/2 of 3/4, we can also see that he used 3.

      To find out how much starlight essence Ruby has left after using some for a potion, we need to subtract the amount she used from the total amount she originally had. Ruby started with 370 ml of starlight essence and used 120 ml for the potion. We can set up the subtraction like this: 370 ml - 120 ml = 250 ml. After performing the subtraction, we find that Ruby has 250 ml of starlight essence remaining. The answer is 250 ml.

      To find out how many milliliters of unicorn tears Cedar has in total, we need to multiply the number of vials by the amount of liquid each vial holds. Cedar has 12 vials, and each vial holds 250 milliliters. We can calculate this by using the equation: 12 vials × 250 milliliters per vial = 3000 milliliters. Therefore, Cedar has a total of 3000 milliliters of unicorn tears. The answer is 3000 milliliters.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many vials of mystic powders Willow and Aspen have together, we first need to determine how many vials Willow is using. Willow has 5 vials, and she combines 3 of them with Aspen's 4 vials. We start by adding the number of vials Willow is using (3) to the number of vials Aspen has (4). This can be expressed mathematically as: 3 vials (from Willow) + 4 vials (from Aspen) = 7 vials. Next, we need to include the 2 vials that Willow is not using. So we add those 2 vials to the 7 vials we just calculated: 7 vials + 2 vials = 9 vials. Finally, we add the total number of vials that Willow originally had (5) to the total number of vials Aspen has (4): 5 vials (Willow) + 4 vials (Aspen) = 9 vials. However, since we are only combining the vials they are using, we only focus on the 3 vials from Willow and the 4 from Aspen, which gives us a total of 12 v.

    <explanation>
      To find out how much enchanted flower essence Elara has left after using some for a potion, we start with the amount she originally has, which is 3/4 of a vial. She uses 1/2 of that amount for the potion. To calculate how much she used, we multiply 3/4 by 1/2: (3/4) × (1/2) = 3/8. Now, we need to subtract the amount she used from the original amount to find out how much remains: 3/4 - 3/8. To subtract these fractions, we first need a common denominator, which is 8. We can convert 3/4 to eighths: 3/4 = 6/8. Now we can subtract: 6/8 - 3/8 = 3/8. Finally, we see that Elara has 3/8 of a vial remaining. However, we need to check if we made a mistake in the question's answer. The correct calculation shows that she has 3/8 left, not 1/4. The answer is 3/8 vial.

      To find out how much fairy dust Vale needs for 5 potions, we start by multiplying the amount of dust used for one potion, which is 3/4 cup, by the number of potions, which is 5. This can be written as: \[ \frac{3}{4} \times 5 = \frac{3 \times 5}{4} = \frac{15}{4} \] Next, we convert \(\frac{15}{4}\) into a mixed number. Since 15 divided by 4 equals 3 with a remainder of 3, we can write this as \(3\) whole cups and \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a cup. Thus, Vale needs a total of 3 3/4 cups of fairy dust for 5 potions. The answer is 3 3/4 cups.

      To find out what fraction of the total potion Ruby created, we need to add the two fractions: 3/4 and 1/2. First, we need a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common denominator of 4 and 2 is 4. Next, we convert 1/2 to a fraction with a denominator of 4. Since 1/2 is equivalent to 2/4, we can now add 3/4 and 2/4 together. When we add these fractions, we get (3 + 2)/4, which equals 5/4. However, we need to find the fraction of the total potion, so we divide 5/4 by 2 (since we mixed two potions). This gives us (5/4) ÷ 2 = 5/8. The answer is 5/8.

      To find out how many days Willow's supply of fairy dust will last, we need to divide the total number of vials by the number of vials she uses each day. Willow has 365 vials and uses 5 vials per day, so we perform the division: 365 ÷ 5 = 73. This means that if Willow uses 5 vials each day, her supply will last for 73 days. The answer is 73 days.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many drops of unicorn tears Iris has, we start by determining what 3/4 of a full vial means. Since a full vial holds 12 drops, we can calculate 3/4 of 12 by multiplying 12 by 3/4. First, we multiply 12 by 3: 12 × 3 = 36. Next, we divide 36 by 4 to find 3/4 of the total: 36 ÷ 4 = 9. Therefore, Iris has 9 drops of unicorn tears. The answer is 9 drops.

      To find the total number of bubbles Clover's potion produces, we need to multiply the number of cauldrons by the number of bubbles each cauldron makes. Since there are 3 cauldrons and each one bubbles 12 times, we can set up the multiplication as follows: 3 cauldrons × 12 bubbles per cauldron = 36 bubbles. Therefore, the total number of bubbles is 36. The answer is 36 bubbles.

      To find out how much of a vial Clover used in total, we need to add the fractions of the two liquids she mixed. Clover used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a vial of phoenix feathers and \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a vial of dragon tears. To add these fractions, we first need a common denominator, which in this case is 4. We can convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4 by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 2, resulting in \( \frac{2}{4} \). Now we can add \( \frac{3}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{5}{4} \). This means Clover used a total of \( \frac{5}{4} \) vials, which can also be expressed as 1 whole vial and \( \frac{1}{4} \) of another vial. The answer is \( \frac{5}{4} \) or \( 1 \frac{1}{4} \) vials.

      To find out how many shimmering vials Hazel has left after using some for potions, we need to perform a subtraction operation. Hazel starts with 1,250 vials and uses 300 vials for potions. We can set up the problem as follows: 1,250 - 300 = 950. After subtracting 300 from 1,250, we find that Hazel has 950 vials remaining. The answer is 950 vials.

      To find out how many crystal vials Finn has left after brewing potions, we need to subtract the number of vials he used from the total number of vials he originally had. Finn started with 12 vials and used 3 vials for his potions. We can set up the subtraction like this: 12 vials (total) - 3 vials (used) = 9 vials (remaining). Therefore, after brewing the potions, Finn has 9 vials left. The answer is 9 vials.

      To find out how long it takes Storm to heat 4 potions, we start by noting that it takes him 5 minutes to heat one potion. Since he needs to heat 4 potions, we can multiply the time for one potion by the number of potions. This can be calculated as follows: 5 minutes per potion × 4 potions = 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time needed to heat all 4 potions is 20 minutes. The answer is 20 minutes.

      To find out how many elixir bottles Ivy has after adding more, we need to perform addition. First, we start with the number of elixir bottles she originally has, which is 1,245. Then, we add the 378 bottles she adds to that amount. We can set up the addition like this: ``` 1,245 + 378 ------- ``` Now, we add the numbers starting from the rightmost column. In the ones place, 5 + 8 equals 13, so we write down 3 and carry over 1. In the tens place, we add 4 + 7, which equals 11, and then we add the 1 we carried over, giving us 12. We write down 2 and carry over 1 again. Finally, in the hundreds place, we add 2 + 3, which equals 5, and then add the 1 we carried over, resulting in 6. Putting it all together, we find that 1,245 plus 378 equals 1,623. The answer is 1,623.

We can calculate the total width by multiplying the width of one pool by the number of pools: 4 feet (width of one pool) × 3 (number of pools) = 12 feet. Therefore, the total width of the pools is 12 feet. The answer is 12 feet.

    <explanation>
      To find out how much elixir Ivy has left after pouring some into the bottles, we first need to calculate the total amount of elixir she pours. Ivy pours 250 milliliters into each of the 5 bottles. We can find the total amount poured by multiplying 250 milliliters by 5: 250 milliliters × 5 = 1,250 milliliters. Next, we subtract the total amount poured from the original amount of elixir. Ivy started with 1,250 milliliters, so we do the following calculation: 1,250 milliliters - 1,250 milliliters = 0 milliliters. However, since the question states that she pours into 5 bottles, we should clarify that she actually has 1,250 milliliters and pours out 1,250 milliliters, leaving her with 0 milliliters. Thus, the correct answer is 1,000 milliliters.

Therefore, the total height of the 3 flames is 15 inches. The answer is 15 inches.

      To find out how many phoenix feathers Luna has left after using some for a potion, we need to perform a subtraction operation. Luna starts with 12 phoenix feathers and uses 5 of them. We can write this as the equation: 12 - 5 = ? Now, we subtract 5 from 12. When we do this calculation, we find that 12 minus 5 equals 7. Therefore, Luna has 7 phoenix feathers remaining. The answer is 7 phoenix feathers.

      To find out how many milliliters of potion all five vials hold, we need to multiply the amount of potion each vial can hold by the number of vials. Each vial holds 250 milliliters, and since there are 5 vials, we calculate this as follows: 250 milliliters × 5 vials = 1250 milliliters. Therefore, the total amount of potion that all the vials can hold is 1250 milliliters. The answer is 1250 milliliters.

      To find out how many miruvor vials Faramir has left after giving some away, we need to perform a subtraction operation. He starts with 1,250 vials and gives away 250 vials. We can write this as the equation: 1,250 - 250 = ? Now, when we subtract 250 from 1,250, we can break it down step by step. First, we subtract the hundreds: 1,200 - 200 equals 1,000. Then, we subtract the tens and ones, which are both zero in this case. Therefore, Faramir has 1,000 vials remaining. The answer is 1,000 vials.

      To find out how many phoenix feathers Felix collected in total, we need to use multiplication. Felix found 4 feathers in each of the 5 enchanted forests. We can calculate the total number of feathers by multiplying the number of feathers per forest (4) by the number of forests (5). So, we perform the calculation: 4 feathers × 5 forests = 20 feathers. The answer is 20 feathers.

    <explanation>
      To find the height of Mia's rectangular box, we can use the formula for volume, which is Volume = length × width × height. We know the volume is 173 erasers, the length is 13 inches, and the width is 11 inches. First, we can plug in the values we have: 

173 = 13 × 11 × height. 

Now, calculate 13 × 11, which equals 143. So, we rewrite the equation as:

173 = 143 × height. 

To find the height, we divide both sides by 143:

height = 173 ÷ 143 = 1.5 inches.

This means the height of the box is 1.5 inches! Great job using the volume formula to solve the problem! You can be confident that this is the correct answer!

    <explanation>
      To find the area of Amina's rectangular mural, we multiply the width by the height: 6 feet (wide) × 4 feet (tall) = 24 square feet. For Raj's square mural, we multiply the length of one side by itself: 5 feet × 5 feet = 25 square feet. So, Raj's mural is larger, with an area of 25 square feet compared to Amina's 24 square feet!

    <explanation>
      To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula \( P = 2 \times (length + width) \). First, we add the length (8 meters) and the width (3 meters) together: \( 8 + 3 = 11 \) meters. Then, we multiply that sum by 2: \( 2 \times 11 = 22 \) meters. So, the perimeter of the rectangle is 22 meters!

    <explanation>
      To find out how much more of his canvas Gabriel painted compared to Fatima, we need to subtract the fraction of Fatima's painting from Gabriel's. 

Gabriel painted \( \frac{5}{8} \) and Fatima painted \( \frac{3}{8} \). So, we do the subtraction: 

\[
\frac{5}{8} - \frac{3}{8} = \frac{2}{8}
\]

Now, we can simplify \( \frac{2}{8} \) by dividing both the top and bottom by 2, which gives us \( \frac{1}{4} \). So, Gabriel painted \( \frac{1}{4} \) more of his canvas than Fatima did!
