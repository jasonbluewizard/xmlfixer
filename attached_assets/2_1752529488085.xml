      Hayden starts with 35 phoenix feathers. He gives 12 feathers to Taylor. To find out how many feathers Hayden has left, we need to subtract 12 from 35. So, we do 35 minus 12, which equals 23. The answer is 23 feathers.

      Blake has 18 crystal vials and wants to share them equally among 3 cauldrons. To find out how many vials go in each cauldron, we can divide 18 by 3. We can count by threes: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18. We see that 18 divided by 3 is 6 because we counted six groups of 3. The answer is 6 vials.

      Riley uses 3 apples every 2 hours. We need to find out how many apples she uses from 10 AM to 4 PM. First, count the hours: from 10 AM to 12 PM is 2 hours, from 12 PM to 2 PM is another 2 hours, and from 2 PM to 4 PM is another 2 hours. That's three sets of 2 hours. For each set, Riley uses 3 apples. So, 3 apples + 3 apples + 3 apples = 9 apples. The answer is 9 apples.

      To find out how many more inches Morgan needs, we first need to know how many inches are in 3 feet. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 3 feet is 3 times 12 inches, which is 36 inches. Morgan already has 16 inches, so we subtract 16 inches from 36 inches. This means Morgan needs 36 - 16 = 20 more inches. The answer is 20 inches.

      Morgan needs 15 ounces of healing herbs, but she only has 9 ounces right now. To find out how many more ounces she needs, we can subtract the amount she has from the amount she needs. So, we do 15 minus 9, which equals 6. The answer is 6 ounces.

      To find out how many crystal vials Taylor has now, we need to add the 47 vials she already has to the 36 vials Riley gives her. We can do this by adding the tens and ones separately. First, add the tens: 40 + 30 = 70. Then, add the ones: 7 + 6 = 13. Finally, add the tens and ones together: 70 + 13 = 83. The answer is 83.

      To find out how many more apples Alex needs, we start with the total number of apples he wants, which is 45. He already has 27 apples. We need to subtract the apples he has from the total he needs: 45 - 27. First, subtract the ones: 5 - 7. Since 5 is less than 7, we need to borrow from the tens. Change 45 to 3 tens and 15 ones. Now, 15 - 7 equals 8. Next, subtract the tens: 3 - 2 equals 1. So, Alex needs 18 more apples. The answer is 18 apples.

      To find out how many herbs Morgan needs, we first need to know how many inches are in 3 feet. Since there are 12 inches in 1 foot, we multiply 3 feet by 12 inches, which gives us 36 inches. Each herb is 6 inches long, so we divide 36 inches by 6 inches per herb. This means Morgan needs 6 herbs. The answer is 6 herbs.

      To find out how many apples Alex used in total, we need to add the apples from each day together. On Monday, Alex used 4 apples. On Tuesday, he used 6 apples. On Wednesday, he used 8 apples. We add these numbers: 4 + 6 + 8. First, 4 + 6 equals 10. Then, 10 + 8 equals 18. The answer is 18 apples.

      Finn has 18 milliliters of moonbeam essence, but he needs 30 milliliters for his potion. To find out how much more he needs, we can subtract the amount he has from the amount he needs: 30 - 18. When we count up from 18 to 30, we find that there are 12 more milliliters needed. The answer is 12 milliliters.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many tens and ones are in 130, we need to look at each digit. The number 130 has a "1" in the hundreds place, a "3" in the tens place, and a "0" in the ones place. The "3" in the tens place means there are 3 tens, and the "0" in the ones place means there are 0 ones. Since the "1" in the hundreds place means there are 10 tens (because 100 is the same as 10 tens), we add those 10 tens to the 3 tens we already have. So, 10 tens plus 3 tens equals 13 tens. The answer is 13 tens, 0 ones.

      To find out who has more drops, we need to compare Meadow's 47 drops with Hazel's 52 drops. We can count up from 47 to 52 to see how many more drops Hazel has. Starting at 47, we count 48, 49, 50, 51, and 52, which is 5 more drops. The answer is Hazel, 5 more drops.

      To find out how much liquid shadow is in the cauldron, we need to add the two amounts together. Ocean starts with 67 milliliters, and Ruby adds 29 milliliters more. We add 67 and 29 by first adding the tens: 60 + 20 = 80. Then, we add the ones: 7 + 9 = 16. Finally, we add 80 and 16 to get 96. The answer is 96 milliliters.

      Cedar starts with 47 vials of liquid shadow. Felix gives him 30 more vials. To find out how many vials Cedar has now, we add 47 and 30 together. First, add the tens: 40 plus 30 equals 70. Then, add the ones: 7 plus 0 equals 7. Finally, combine the tens and ones: 70 plus 7 equals 77. The answer is 77 vials.

    <explanation>
      To find out who has more units of magical energy, we need to compare the numbers 427 and 472. First, look at the hundreds place: 427 has 4 hundreds, and 472 has 4 hundreds, so they are the same. Next, look at the tens place: 427 has 2 tens, and 472 has 7 tens. Since 7 tens is more than 2 tens, 472 is greater than 427. The answer is Rowan.

      Hazel starts with 152 magical ingredients. She uses 47 of them, so we need to find out how many are left. To do this, we subtract 47 from 152. First, subtract the ones: 2 minus 7 is not possible, so we need to borrow from the tens. Change the 5 tens to 4 tens, and the 2 ones become 12 ones. Now, 12 minus 7 equals 5. Next, subtract the tens: 4 minus 4 equals 0. Finally, subtract the hundreds: 1 minus 0 equals 1. So, Hazel has 105 ingredients left. The answer is 105 ingredients.

      To find the potion with the most energy, we need to compare the numbers 300, 450, and 600. We start by looking at the hundreds place in each number. The number 300 has a 3, the number 450 has a 4, and the number 600 has a 6. Since 6 is the biggest number, 600 is the largest amount of energy. The answer is 600 units.

    <explanation>
      To find out who has more flasks, we need to compare the numbers 58 and 85. Meadow has 85 flasks, and Ruby has 58 flasks. We subtract 58 from 85 to see how many more flasks Meadow has: 85 - 58 = 27. So, Meadow has 27 more flasks than Ruby. The answer is Meadow, 27 more flasks.

      Ocean needs a total of 150 pinches of starflower petal dust for her potion. She already has 75 pinches. To find out how many more pinches she needs, we subtract the 75 pinches she has from the 150 pinches she needs. So, 150 minus 75 equals 75. The answer is 75 pinches.

      Storm starts with 35 drops of crystallized dragon tears. Jasper gives him 18 more drops. To find out how many drops Storm has now, we add the two numbers together: 35 + 18. First, add the ones: 5 + 8 equals 13. Write down the 3 and carry over the 1. Next, add the tens: 3 + 1 equals 4, and don't forget to add the 1 you carried over, which makes it 5. So, 35 + 18 equals 53. The answer is 53 drops.

      To find out how many tens and ones are in the number 18, we start by looking at the number. The number 18 has two digits: the "1" and the "8." The "1" is in the tens place, which means it represents 1 group of ten. The "8" is in the ones place, which means it represents 8 individual ones. The answer is 1 ten and 8 ones.

      To find out who has more flasks, we need to compare the numbers 57 and 75. First, we look at the tens place: 57 has 5 tens, and 75 has 7 tens. Since 7 is more than 5, we know 75 is greater than 57. To find out how many more flasks Meadow has, we subtract 57 from 75. 75 - 57 = 18. The answer is Meadow, by 18 flasks.

      To find out who has more magic mushrooms, we need to compare the numbers 78 and 87. First, look at the tens place: 78 has 7 tens, and 87 has 8 tens. Since 8 tens is more than 7 tens, 87 is greater than 78. The answer is Meadow.

      Hazel starts with the number 32 for her first elixir bottle. To find the number for the 5th bottle, we count up by 1 for each bottle: 32, 33, 34, 35, and then 36. So, the 5th bottle in the sequence is number 36. The answer is 36.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many bubbles Hazel's cauldron makes in 5 minutes, we can use multiplication. First, we know that the cauldron bubbles 8 times in 1 minute. If we want to find out how many bubbles it makes in 5 minutes, we can multiply 8 by 5. So, we do the math: 8 bubbles × 5 minutes = 40 bubbles. The answer is 40 bubbles.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many spell ingredients Luna has, we need to add the number of phoenix feathers and dragon tears together. Luna has 5 phoenix feathers and 3 dragon tears. We can write this as: 5 (phoenix feathers) + 3 (dragon tears) = 8 (total ingredients). So, when we add them up, we see that Luna has 8 ingredients in total. The answer is 8 ingredients.

      Briar has 5 crystal vials, and in each vial, she brews 3 potions. To find out how many potions she has in total, we can multiply the number of vials by the number of potions in each vial. So, we do 5 vials times 3 potions, which equals 15 potions. The answer is 15 potions.

      Iris has 5 vials of unicorn tears. If she gives 2 vials to Luna, we need to find out how many vials Iris has left. We can do this by subtracting the 2 vials from the 5 vials: 5 vials - 2 vials = 3 vials. So, Iris has 3 vials left. The answer is 3 vials.

      Cedar has 147 drops of unicorn tears. He uses 47 drops for a potion. To find out how many drops are left, we need to subtract 47 from 147. First, we can think of it like this: 147 minus 47 equals 100. So, after using the drops for the potion, Cedar has 100 drops remaining. The answer is 100 drops.

      Hazel starts with 25 potions in her cauldron. If she brews 7 more potions, we need to add these two numbers together. So, we do 25 plus 7. First, we can count up from 25: - 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. When we finish counting, we find that there are 32 potions in the cauldron now. The answer is 32 potions.

      Fatima and Noah are building a garden in their backyard. Fatima wants to create a rectangular flower bed that is 4 feet long and 3 feet wide.

      </choice>
      <choice id="C">
        Fatima's flower bed has an area of 16 square feet, while Noah's vegetable patch has an area of 9 square feet.

        Fatima's flower bed has an area of 17 square feet, while Noah's vegetable patch has an area of 9 square feet.
      </choice>
    </choices>
    <explanation>
      To find the area of Fatima's flower bed, we multiply the length (4 feet) by the width (3 feet), which gives us 12 square feet. For Noah's vegetable patch, since it's a square, we multiply one side (3 feet) by itself, which gives us 9 square feet. So, Fatima's flower bed is bigger because 12 square feet is more than 9 square feet!

    <explanation>
      To find out how many more units long Marcus's rectangle is than one side of Fatima's square, we first look at the length of Marcus's rectangle, which is 4 units. Then, we check the length of one side of Fatima's square, which is 3 units. Now, we subtract the length of the square from the length of the rectangle: 4 units (rectangle) - 3 units (square) = 1 unit. So, Marcus's rectangle is 1 unit longer than one side of Fatima's square!
