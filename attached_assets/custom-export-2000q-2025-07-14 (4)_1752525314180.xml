      </choices>
      <explanation><![CDATA[The ratio of powdered unicorn horn to moonbeam essence in the recipe is 2:5. This means for every 2 parts of powdered unicorn horn, there are 5 parts of moonbeam essence. If the apprentices have 10 parts of powdered unicorn horn, you set up the proportion 2/5 = 10/x, where x represents the parts of moonbeam essence needed. Solving the proportion, 2x = 50, leads to x = 25. Therefore, they need 25 parts of moonbeam essence to maintain the correct ratio.]]></explanation>

      <explanation><![CDATA[The ratio of glowing phoenix feathers to crystallized dragon tears is 3:2. If 12 parts of glowing phoenix feathers are used, we set up the proportion 3/2 = 12/x, where x is the number of parts of crystallized dragon tears needed. Solving for x, we multiply both sides by x to get 3x = 24, and then divide by 3 to find x = 8.

      <explanation><![CDATA[The potion maker's recipe has a ratio of unicorn hair to dragon scale of 4:3. This means for every 4 parts of unicorn hair, 3 parts of dragon scale are needed. If the potion maker uses 8 parts of unicorn hair, this is two times the original amount (8 ÷ 4 = 2). Therefore, the amount of dragon scale needed is also two times the original 3 parts, which is 6 parts. Hence, the correct answer is C: 6 parts.]]></explanation>

Convert each fraction: 2/3 = 8/12, 1/4 = 3/12, and 1/3 = 4/12. Add them together: 8/12 + 3/12 + 4/12 = 15/12. Simplify 15/12 to 1 1/6 cups. Therefore, the total amount of liquid is 1 1/6 cups.]]></explanation>

If the unicorn tears are increased to 9 parts, we must find the equivalent number of parts for dragon scales to keep the ratio consistent. Since 9 parts of unicorn tears is 3 times the original amount (3 x 3 = 9), we must also multiply the original 2 parts of dragon scales by 3 (2 x 3 = 6) to maintain the ratio. Therefore, 6 parts of dragon scales are needed.]]></explanation>

      <explanation><![CDATA[To find the total amount of mixture, you add the fractions 3/4 and 2/4. When adding fractions with the same denominator, you add the numerators and keep the denominator the same. So, 3/4 + 2/4 = (3+2)/4 = 5/4. Since 5/4 is an improper fraction, it can be converted into a mixed number, which is 1 1/4 cups. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 1 1/4 cups.]]></explanation>

      <explanation><![CDATA[To solve this problem, we need to find out how many parts of phoenix feathers are needed for 12 parts of dragon scales. The ratio of dragon scales to phoenix feathers is 3:4. This means that for every 3 parts of dragon scales, we need 4 parts of phoenix feathers. 

If we have 12 parts of dragon scales, we can set up a proportion to find the equivalent number of parts of phoenix feathers:

3 parts dragon scales / 4 parts phoenix feathers = 12 parts dragon scales / x parts phoenix feathers

By solving the proportion, we cross-multiply to get:

3x = 48

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

x = 16

Therefore, 16 parts of phoenix feathers are needed when using 12 parts of dragon scales.]]></explanation>

      <explanation><![CDATA[To find the height of the bottle, we need to calculate the volume of the rectangular prism that can hold 36 cubic units. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is V = l * w * h. Given that the base is a square with sides of 3 units, the area of the base is 3 * 3 = 9 square units. To find the height, divide the total volume by the area of the base: 36 cubic units ÷ 9 square units = 4 units. Therefore, the height of the bottle should be 4 units. The correct answer is A: 4 units.]]></explanation>

      <explanation><![CDATA[To keep the potion balanced, the ratio of dragon scale powder to phoenix feather dust must be 3:2. If 9 parts of dragon scale powder are used, we can set up a proportion: 3/2 = 9/x, where x is the number of parts of phoenix feather dust needed. Solving for x, we cross-multiply to get 3x = 18, which simplifies to x = 6. Therefore, the student should use 6 parts of phoenix feather dust.]]></explanation>

Since the ratio of dragon scales to unicorn tears is 3:5, we can set up a proportion: (3 scoops / 5 cups) = (15 scoops / x cups). Solving for x, we multiply both sides by x and then by 5 to get 3x = 75. Dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 25 cups. Therefore, the student should use 25 cups of unicorn tears.]]></explanation>

      <explanation><![CDATA[To find out how much more dragon's breath is needed, we subtract the amount already added (1/2 cup) from the total amount needed (5/6 cup). First, we need a common denominator to subtract the fractions. The least common denominator between 6 and 2 is 6. Convert 1/2 to 3/6. Now subtract: 5/6 - 3/6 = 2/6. Simplifying 2/6 gives us 1/3. Therefore, the student needs to add 1/3 cup more dragon's breath.]]></explanation>

        <choice>6 cups</choice>
        <choice>10 cups</choice>
      </choices>
      <explanation><![CDATA[To solve this, we first need to convert the 2 liters into milliliters. Since there are 1000 milliliters in a liter, 2 liters is equal to 2000 milliliters. Each cup holds 250 milliliters, so we divide 2000 milliliters by 250 milliliters per cup to find the number of cups needed: 2000 ÷ 250 = 8 cups. Therefore, 8 cups are needed to measure 2 liters of dragon's breath.]]></explanation>

      <explanation><![CDATA[The original ratio of dragon scales to phoenix feathers is 2:3. This means for every 2 cups of dragon scales, you need 3 cups of phoenix feathers. If the potion master uses 4 cups of dragon scales, which is twice as much as originally, she must also double the amount of phoenix feathers to maintain the same ratio. Therefore, she needs 2 times 3 cups of phoenix feathers, which is 6 cups.]]></explanation>

To determine how many parts of dragon scales are needed for 9 parts of unicorn tears, set up a proportion: 3/2 = 9/x. Solve for x by cross-multiplying: 3x = 18. Dividing both sides by 3 gives x = 6. Therefore, 6 parts of dragon scales are needed.]]></explanation>

      </choices>
      <explanation><![CDATA[The correct answer is B: A 250 milliliter cup used once. This is because the recipe asks for exactly 250 milliliters of dragon tears, and using a 250 milliliter cup once will give the exact amount needed. While other options might eventually reach 250 milliliters, option B is the most straightforward and accurate choice without needing additional steps.]]></explanation>

      <explanation><![CDATA[The potion recipe specifies a ratio of 3 parts dragon's breath to 2 parts phoenix feather. To find how much dragon's breath is needed for 8 parts of phoenix feather, set up a proportion: 3/2 = x/8. Cross-multiply to find x: 3 * 8 = 2 * x, which simplifies to 24 = 2x. Solving for x, divide both sides by 2 to get x = 12. Therefore, you need 12 parts of dragon's breath.]]></explanation>

      <explanation><![CDATA[The original recipe uses a ratio of 3 parts unicorn horn powder to 2 parts dragon scales. This is a ratio of 3:2. If the student uses 9 parts of unicorn horn powder, we need to find the equivalent number of parts of dragon scales to maintain the same ratio. Since 9 is 3 times the original 3 parts (3 x 3 = 9), we also need to multiply the 2 parts of dragon scales by 3 (2 x 3 = 6). Therefore, 6 parts of dragon scales are needed.]]></explanation>

We know the perimeter is 24 cm and the length is 7 cm, so we have: 24 = 2 * (7 + width). Simplifying, we get 24 = 14 + 2 * width. Subtracting 14 from both sides gives 10 = 2 * width.

      <explanation><![CDATA[The ratio of Glowing Berries to Crystal Water is 2:3. This means for every 2 parts of Glowing Berries, there are 3 parts of Crystal Water. If 10 Glowing Berries are used, we have to multiply the entire ratio by 5 (since 10 ÷ 2 = 5) to maintain the ratio. Therefore, 3 parts of Crystal Water must also be multiplied by 5, resulting in 15 parts of Crystal Water.]]></explanation>

If the student uses 6 parts of unicorn tears, we can set up a proportion to find how many parts of dragon scales are needed: (3/2) = (6/x). Solving for x, we cross-multiply to get 3x = 12, therefore x = 4. The student should use 4 parts of dragon scales.]]></explanation>

      <explanation><![CDATA[The ratio of dragon scale powder to unicorn hair is 2:3. This means for every 3 parts of unicorn hair, 2 parts of dragon scale powder are needed. If a student uses 10 parts of unicorn hair, we set up a proportion: (2 parts dragon scale / 3 parts unicorn hair) = (x parts dragon scale / 10 parts unicorn hair). Solving for x gives us x = (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67. Since we are counting parts, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Thus, the student needs 6 parts of dragon scale powder.]]></explanation>

      <explanation><![CDATA[The ratio given in the potion recipe is 4 parts of unicorn tears to 3 parts of dragon scales. To maintain this ratio, set up a proportion: 4/3 = x/6, where x is the number of parts of unicorn tears needed. Solving the proportion, we have 4/3 = x/6. Cross-multiply to get 4 * 6 = 3 * x, which simplifies to 24 = 3x. Dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 8. Therefore, 8 parts of unicorn tears are needed when using 6 parts of dragon scales.]]></explanation>

      <explanation><![CDATA[To solve this problem, we first note that the total parts of the potion is the sum of the unicorn tears and dragon scales. The ratio of unicorn tears to dragon scales is 3:5. Therefore, the total number of ratio parts is 3 + 5 = 8. If the student wants to use 24 parts in total, we set up a proportion: 3/8 = x/24, where x is the number of parts of unicorn tears. Solving for x, we multiply both sides by 24: x = (3/8) * 24 = 9. Thus, the student should use 9 parts of unicorn tears.]]></explanation>

        <choice>14</choice>
      </choices>
      <explanation><![CDATA[To find the total number of faces, we need to count the faces of each shape and add them together. A cube has 6 faces, a sphere has 0 faces, and a cylinder has 3 faces (2 circular faces and 1 curved face). Therefore, the total number of faces is 3 cubes * 6 faces/cube + 2 spheres * 0 faces/sphere + 1 cylinder * 3 faces/cylinder = 18 + 0 + 3 = 21 faces. However, I made a mistake! Let's correct it: a cylinder actually has 2 circular faces and 1 curved, but the curved doesn't count as a 'face' in this context, so it should be 2 faces. Therefore, the correct calculation is 18 + 0 + 2 = 20 faces. The correct answer is A: 20.]]></explanation>

      <explanation><![CDATA[The original ratio of unicorn hair to dragon scales is 3:5. If you double the amount of unicorn hair to 6 parts, you must also double the amount of dragon scales to maintain the ratio. Therefore, 5 parts of dragon scales should also be doubled to 10 parts. This means for every 3 parts of unicorn hair, you have 5 parts of dragon scales. Thus, for 6 parts of unicorn hair, you need 15 parts of dragon scales to maintain the ratio.]]></explanation>

      <questionText><![CDATA[A potion maker is experimenting with a new potion recipe. She records the number of drops of a magic ingredient she adds each time and the resulting potion color. The data she collected is shown below:

1. 3 drops - Light Blue
2. 6 drops - Blue
3. 9 drops - Dark Blue
4. 12 drops - Very Dark Blue

Based on the pattern in the data, predict the color of the potion if she adds 15 drops of the magic ingredient.]]></questionText>

      <explanation><![CDATA[The ratio of dragon scale powder to unicorn horn dust is 3:4. This means for every 3 grams of dragon scale powder, you need 4 grams of unicorn horn dust. If the student uses 12 grams of dragon scale powder, you set up a proportion: 3/4 = 12/x, where x is the amount of unicorn horn dust needed. Solving for x, you multiply both sides by x and then by 4, to get: 3x = 48. Dividing both sides by 3 gives x = 16. Therefore, the student should use 16 grams of unicorn horn dust.]]></explanation>

      <explanation><![CDATA[The original ratio of dragon scales to unicorn hair is 3:4. To maintain this ratio, we can set up a proportion. If 3 parts of dragon scales correspond to 4 parts of unicorn hair, then 12 parts of dragon scales should correspond to x parts of unicorn hair. We solve the proportion: 3/4 = 12/x. Cross-multiplying gives us 3x = 48, and solving for x gives us x = 16. Therefore, the student needs 16 parts of unicorn hair.]]></explanation>

      <explanation><![CDATA[The original recipe uses 3 parts of herb extract for every 5 parts of dragon scale dust. To find the amount of herb extract needed for 30 parts of dragon scale dust, we set up a proportion: 3/5 = x/30. Solving for x, we cross-multiply: 3 * 30 = 5 * x, which simplifies to 90 = 5x. Dividing both sides by 5 gives x = 18. Therefore, they need 18 parts of herb extract.]]></explanation>

      <explanation><![CDATA[First, calculate the radius of the cauldron. The radius is half of the diameter, so the radius is 12 ÷ 2 = 6 units. Next, find the area of the entire cauldron using the formula for the area of a circle, A = πr². Substituting the known values, A = 3.14 × 6² = 3.14 × 36 = 113.04 square units. Since there are 3 equal sections, divide the total area by 3 to find the area of one section: 113.04 ÷ 3 = 37.68 square units.
