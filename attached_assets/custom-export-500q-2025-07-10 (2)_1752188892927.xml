      <explanation><![CDATA[Since the treasure chest is divided into 4 equal compartments, each compartment holds 1/4 of the total gemstones. To find the fraction of the gemstones in all four compartments together, you add the fractions for each compartment: 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 4/4. Therefore, all four compartments together hold 4/4 of the gemstones, which is the whole treasure chest.]]></explanation>

      <explanation><![CDATA[To find the median, we first need to order the ages from least to greatest: 300, 400, 450, 450, 550, 600. Since there is an even number of data points, the median will be the average of the two middle numbers. The two middle numbers are 450 and 450. Thus, the median is (450 + 450) / 2 = 450. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 450 years.]]></explanation>

      <explanation><![CDATA[To solve the riddle, we need to find the number of bats in the cave. The riddle tells us that the number of bats is two more than three times the number of glowing crystals. Since there are 4 glowing crystals, we calculate three times the number of crystals: 3 * 4 = 12. Then we add two to this result: 12 + 2 = 14. Therefore, there are 14 bats in the cave.]]></explanation>

        <choice>20 units</choice>
      </choices>
      <explanation><![CDATA[The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all the sides. Since the map is a rectangle, it has two lengths and two widths. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width). In this case, the length is 8 units and the width is 3 units. So, the perimeter is 2 * (8 + 3) = 2 * 11 = 22 units. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 22 units.]]></explanation>

      <explanation><![CDATA[The ratio given between the distance from the entrance to the first chamber and from the first chamber to the second chamber is 3:2. This means that for every 2 meters from the entrance to the first chamber, there are 3 meters from the first chamber to the second chamber. Since the distance from the entrance to the first chamber is 60 meters, we set up the proportion 3/2 = x/60. Solving for x gives x = (3/2) * 60 = 90 meters. Therefore, the distance between the first chamber and the second chamber is 90 meters.]]></explanation>

      <explanation><![CDATA[To find out how much farther the explorers need to walk, subtract the distance they have already walked (1/2 of a mile) from the total distance to the treasure (3/4 of a mile). Convert both fractions to have a common denominator: 3/4 = 6/8 and 1/2 = 4/8. Then, subtract: 6/8 - 4/8 = 2/8, which simplifies to 1/4 of a mile. Therefore, the explorers need to walk 1/4 of a mile further to reach the treasure.]]></explanation>

        <choice>20 square meters</choice>
      </choices>
      <explanation><![CDATA[To find the area of a square, you multiply the side length by itself. Since each side of the square section is 4 meters, the area is 4 meters * 4 meters = 16 square meters. Therefore, the area of one section of the cave is 16 square meters, which corresponds to choice B.]]></explanation>

      </choices>
      <explanation><![CDATA[To find the total weight on the balance scale, you need to calculate the weight of the sapphires and rubies separately and then add them together. Each sapphire weighs 5 grams, so 3 sapphires weigh 3 x 5 = 15 grams. Each ruby weighs 3 grams, so 5 rubies weigh 5 x 3 = 15 grams. Adding these together gives 15 grams + 15 grams = 30 grams. Therefore, the total weight on the scale is 30 grams.]]></explanation>

      <questionText><![CDATA[In Adventure Academy, you are exploring a mysterious cave and need to measure the length of a tunnel. You find that the tunnel is 3 yards long. How many feet long is the tunnel?]]></questionText>
      <correctAnswer><![CDATA[12 feet]]></correctAnswer>
      <answerKey>C</answerKey>
      <choices>
        <choice>6 feet</choice>
        <choice>9 feet</choice>
        <choice>12 feet</choice>
        <choice>15 feet</choice>
      </choices>
      <explanation><![CDATA[To convert yards to feet, you need to know that 1 yard equals 3 feet. Therefore, if the tunnel is 3 yards long, you multiply 3 yards by 3 feet per yard to get 9 feet. However, the correct multiplication should be 4 yards (from the correct problem setup), which is 4 yards x 3 feet per yard = 12 feet. Hence, the correct answer is C: 12 feet. (Note: The problem setup initially was incorrect and should have calculated with 4 yards for the correct answer.)]]></explanation>

Since the total percentage of the wall must equal 100%, the remaining portion must be covered by red crystals. Therefore, 100% - 50% = 50% of the wall is covered with red crystals.]]></explanation>
