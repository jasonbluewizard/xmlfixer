      Wren starts with 12 vials of liquid shadow. She gives some to Willow and has 7 vials left. To find out how many vials she gave to Willow, we can count how many more vials are needed to go from 7 back to 12. Starting from 7, we count up: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. We count 5 numbers, so Wren gave 5 vials to Willow. The answer is 5 vials.

      To find out how many tens and ones are in 32, we can break the number into parts. First, we look at the number 32 and see that it has two digits. The first digit, 3, tells us how many groups of ten there are. The second digit, 2, tells us how many ones are left over. So, 32 is made up of 3 tens and 2 ones. The answer is 3 tens, 2 ones.

      Vale starts with 15 enchanted stirring rods. Sage gives him 26 more stirring rods. To find out how many stirring rods Vale has now, we add 15 and 26 together. First, we add the tens: 10 from 15 and 20 from 26, which makes 30. Then, we add the ones: 5 from 15 and 6 from 26, which makes 11. Finally, we add 30 and 11 together to get 41. The answer is 41 enchanted stirring rods.

    <explanation>
      To find out how many tens and ones are in 29 grams, we can look at the number 29. The first digit, 2, tells us how many groups of ten there are. So, there are 2 tens. The second digit, 9, tells us how many ones are left over. So, there are 9 ones. The answer is 2 tens and 9 ones.

      Clover starts with 35 drops of liquid time. She uses 12 drops for her potion. To find out how many drops are left, we need to subtract 12 from 35. We can count back from 35, taking away 12 drops. When we do this, we find that Clover has 23 drops left. The answer is 23 drops.

      River starts with 14 enchanted stirring rods. When Ocean gives River 10 more rods, we need to add these two numbers together. So, we count starting from 14 and add 10 more: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. Now, River has 24 enchanted stirring rods. The answer is 24 enchanted stirring rods.

      Luna needs 60 grams of powdered unicorn horn, but she only has 20 grams. To find out how many more grams she needs, we can count up from 20 to 60. First, we count from 20 to 30, which is 10 grams. Then, we count from 30 to 60, which is another 30 grams. So, 10 grams plus 30 grams equals 40 grams. The answer is 40 grams.

      To find out how much concentrated lightning Cedar needs in each portion, we start with 90 milliliters. Cedar wants to divide this into 3 equal parts. We can think of it like sharing 90 milliliters equally among 3 friends. If we count by tens, we can see that 90 divided into 3 parts is 30 milliliters each. The answer is 30 milliliters.

      Luna starts with 30 bubbles in her cauldron. If 12 bubbles pop, we need to find out how many bubbles are left. To do this, we can subtract 12 from 30. So, we do the math: 30 - 12 = 18. This means there are 18 bubbles left. The answer is 18 bubbles.

    </choices>
    <explanation>
      To find the perimeter of Lucas's square sandbox, we need to add up all the sides. A square has 4 sides, and each side is 4 feet long. So, we can count: 4 feet + 4 feet + 4 feet + 4 feet. When we add those together, we get 16 feet! This is the correct way to find the perimeter because the perimeter is just the total distance around the sandbox. Great job, you found the answer: 16 feet!
