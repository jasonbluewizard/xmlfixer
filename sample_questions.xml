    <explanation><![CDATA[To find the number of ways to arrange 24 vials in equal rows, we need to find all the factor pairs of 24. The factors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. The factor pairs are: (1,24), (2,12), (3,8), and (4,6). Since we can also reverse these pairs, we have 8 different arrangements: 1×24, 2×12, 3×8, 4×6, 6×4, 8×3, 12×2, and 24×1.]]></explanation>
